A high-performance, responsive React application designed to manage and track job applications in real-time. This project demonstrates a complete frontend-to-backend integration using a modern tech stack and "Industry Standard" UI/UX patterns.

## 🧱 The Build Journey (Bricks 1-7)

This project was built incrementally, ensuring each layer of the architecture was solid before moving to the next:

* **Brick 1: Foundation Setup** - Initialized the React project with TypeScript and Vite for lightning-fast development.
* **Brick 2: Component Architecture** - Defined the core `JobApplication` interfaces and the folder structure.
* **Brick 3: API Integration Layer** - Built a robust `agent.ts` using Axios to communicate with the .NET 8 REST API.
* **Brick 4: Global State & Dashboard** - Created the centralized dashboard logic to manage application state and handle "Demo Data" fallbacks.
* **Brick 5: The Glass-Morphism UI** - Implemented Tailwind CSS v4 to create a dark-themed, visually appealing dashboard with consistent spacing.
* **Brick 6: JobCard Component** - Developed the interactive card system featuring dynamic status color-coding and hover animations.
